<h2>--</h2>
<h2>Potential Features:</h2>
    <li>Automatic detection of when the user enters a new country (Maybe notified by NotificationCenter).<br /></li>
    <li>Color coding based on visited vs wanting to visit.<br /></li>
    <li>Color coding based on the year/month visited.<br /></li>
    <li>Attaching notes to different countries so that when you click on it you can view them.<br /></li>
    <li>Saving cities visited.<br /></li>
    <li>Friends list.<br /></li>
    <li>Viewing friends map.<br /></li>
    <li>Being able to tag friends in notes possibly or say that you travelled with a friend.<br /></li>
    <li>Save photos of places you visited and also share them with friends.<br /></li>
    <li>Pop-up window showing local places recommended by Google etc.<br /></li>

<h2>High Level Architecture:</h2>
    <li>Loading screen with app logo and name.</li>
    <li>Fully zoomed out map, with coloring (maybe we can have a toggle at the top that lets you select which coloring mode you are in whether that be visited/not visited or based on the year visited)</li>
    <li>Users can switch between the map view or a table view of countries to their preference.</li>
    <li>Zoom in to different regions (or select the country in the table view) and see details like the cities you vistied and being able to click into the notes you left. Also would be able to enter some sort of editing mode where you can search or click a country to highlight and change the color of. Searching a country would isolate it.</li>
    <li>I imagine this whole thing being on tab of a tab bar controller. Other tabs might include a friends list (table view of you friends to click into), my profile tab and maybe something like a notfications tab where you can see your friends interactions with you map. Lastly, a tab where you can see a list view of the countries with filters and search as well for a more manageable view of the countries.</li>

<h2>Project Goals:</h2>
    <li>1. Getting mapkit up and running.<br /></li>
    <li>2. Searching countries and isolating them.<br /></li>
    <li>3. Color coding and categorizing countries.<br /></li>
    <li>4. Highlighting cities and leaving notes once you've colored a country.<br /></li>
    <li>5. Get a working friends list viewable from one device to another.<br /></li>
    <li>6. Creating interactions between friends.<br /></li>
    <li>7. Deploying an app to the App Store.<br /></li>
